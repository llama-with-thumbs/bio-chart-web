# First Step: Image Processing
The initial step involves processing the raw image, which includes tasks such as:

- Aligning the image to a level position.
- Cropping out the necessary portions.
- Saving the processed images for later use.

In addition, images are saved in a database (Firebase is used, but consideration is given to switching to a more convenient solution).

# Second Step: Color Channel Extraction
The second step involves extracting color channel values from the images and saving them to the database.
